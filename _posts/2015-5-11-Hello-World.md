Hi, my name is David Muller and I do research in cancer epidemiology. At this stage I have no idea  what form this blog will take precisely, but I imagine that it will be a mix of links to stuff that I find interesting or helpful in my work, as well as the occasional comment on current research in epidemiology and biostatistics.
